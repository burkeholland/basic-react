# Basic React App With Routing

This app is a basic React application created with create-react-app.

To run it... 

* Clone this repo and run `npm install`.
* Run `npm start`

## Available Routes

The Home route is shown by default. The About route can be navigated to by clicking on the menu item or adding `/about` to the URL.

Navigating to a url that does not exist (i.e. `/imnothere`) will show a "page not found" message within the app shell.
